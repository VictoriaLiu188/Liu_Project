# Liu_Project
Hello this is Victoria Liu from the Toronto Bracnh of BrainHack2023!
The topic of my project is to use deep learning and MEG to investigate the quality of learning.

Project repository: https://github.com/VictoriaLiu188/Liu_Project

Hub: Toronto

Goals of project: 
1. categorize MEG sensor space amplitude/frequency band power to learned and un-learned objects by applying neural networks

Data and tools
1.  My own set of MEG dataset from MA 
2.  Python
